Hi! I'm Peter and I'm 20 years old. I grew up in a small town in Austria and I've always liked
building things. I studied Computer Science at TU Munich for one year, then went on an adventure and
did a bunch of internships. I worked on infrastructure at Google, Facebook and Bloomberg in
London. I also did blue-skies deep learning research at an AI startup, and worked on applying novel
machine learning methods to cell biology at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge. I'm
now back at Facebook in Silicon Valley, making the world more open and connected.

I think the world and our society is broken in many ways and has far too many inefficiencies. I'm
excited to be learning things and working on problems that will help change that.

I also like taking the path less traveled by. I like being far away from the mean of normal
distributions. I like being curious and asking questions. I like questioning defaults and being
skeptical about what we accept as norms, if those norms limit our potential and increase the
distance between what is and what should be. I like changing definitions. I like tearing down
walls. I like breaking down what is old to make space for what is new. I like proving that hard work
overcomes all obstacles.

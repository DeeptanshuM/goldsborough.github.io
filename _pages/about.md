Hi, I'm Peter and I'm 20 years old. I grew up in a small town in Austria and
I've always liked building things. I studied Computer Science at TU Munich for
one year, then went on an adventure to do internships at Google, Facebook,
Bloomberg and an AI startup in London. Right now, I'm finding synergies between
modern machine learning methods and biomedical research at the Broad Institute
of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This fall I'm continuing my
adventure at Facebook in Silicon Valley.

I enjoy the intersection of blue-skies machine learning research and low-level
infrastructure engineering.

I also like taking the path less traveled by. I like being curious and asking
questions. I like questioning defaults and being skeptical about what we accept
as norms, if those norms limit our potential and increase the distance between
what is and what should be. I like changing definitions. I like tearing down
walls. I like breaking down what is old to make space for what is new.

I’m Peter, $\sqrt{324}$ years old and I really love how computer science enables
me to solve problems and leave an impact on the world. I’m especially fascinated
by machine learning, data science, database engineering, low level electronics &
hardware hacking and any kind of application development.

What I call fun is coming up with an idea for a project that solves a problem
and coding away. By preference I’ll use C++ or Python for that, although I love
how being open minded and learning a new technology can lead to even better
results. I’m a fanatic about code style and quality and I really enjoy great
software engineering, from design patterns to debating about what algorithms or
data structures to use. I think code should be more than what it does. In that
sense code is a lot like a sandwich. It should do its job of filling you, but
isn’t it much nicer when the sandwich is well organized and looks pretty too?

I’m currently a first year CS student at Technical University of Munich. When
I'm not working on my own projects, I work as a Research Assistant on two
separate projects in parallel at the University of Klagenfurt and at Technical
University of Munich. In Klagenfurt I'm part of the Institute of Networked and
Embedded Systems where I'm building smart, unsupervised energy-monitoring
algorithms to optimize energy-consumption. In Munich I'm with the the Chair for
Database Systems, where I'm investigating if inter-process communication or
shared-memory are an alternative to TCP sockets for low-latency transmission of
database queries.

Starting this August I’ll be spending eight months doing back-to-back
software-engineering internships in London. The first three months I'll be at
Google, working on a platform to visualize Google's ad technologies. After a
good 48 hours vacation (i.e. the weekend) I'm then doing another 4 months at
Bloomberg R&D, working on something with C++ (looking for a project right now).

I'm more online than outside really, so you can find me in lots of places. I
love and live open-source, so you’ll find my second home to be Github
([github.com/goldsborough](http://github.com/goldsborough)). I used to ramble on
another blog, [thecodeinn.blogspot.com](http://github.com/goldsborough), where
you'll find more technology-related articles I wrote to give back to the
community. Lastly, be sure to add me on
[LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/petergoldsborough).
